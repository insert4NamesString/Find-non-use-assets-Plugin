# Find non use assets
**What is it?**
This Obsidian plugin deletes non-use embedded files by comparing file names inside a folder and links in a note.
**Some Limitations**:
1. Each line needs to contain one linked file. (I only test with one link per line.)
2. It is recurring to restart Obsidian once this plugin runs to refresh the layout and changes in folders.
